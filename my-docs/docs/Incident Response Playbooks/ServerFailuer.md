# Incident Response Playbook: Server Failure

## Objective

To provide a structured approach to identify, mitigate, and resolve server failures to minimize downtime and impact.

## Steps

### 1. Detection

- Monitor server health using automated tools (e.g., uptime monitoring, logs).
- Identify symptoms such as:
  - Server unresponsive.
  - High CPU/memory usage.
  - Application errors.

### 2. Notification

- Notify the on-call engineer immediately.
- Escalate to the appropriate team if required.

### 3. Containment

- Isolate the affected server from the network if necessary.
- Redirect traffic to backup servers or enable failover mechanisms.

### 4. Diagnosis

- Check server logs for errors.
- Verify resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk).
- Run diagnostic tools to identify hardware or software issues.

### 5. Mitigation

- Restart services or the server if applicable.
- Apply patches or updates to resolve known issues.
- Replace faulty hardware components.

### 6. Recovery

- Restore the server to normal operation.
- Verify that all services are functioning correctly.
- Monitor the server for stability.

### 7. Post-Incident Review

- Document the root cause and resolution steps.
- Update monitoring and alerting systems to prevent recurrence.
- Share findings with the team for knowledge sharing.
