# Preparing System Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Objective

To document architectural decisions in a structured format to ensure clarity, traceability, and alignment with project goals.

## Structure of an ADR

Each ADR should follow this template:

### 1. Title

- A short, descriptive title for the decision.

### 2. Status

- Current status of the decision (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated).

### 3. Context

- Background information and the problem being addressed.
- Include relevant technical, business, or project constraints.

### 4. Decision

- The decision made, including the chosen solution or approach.
- Provide reasoning for the decision.

### 5. Consequences

- Positive and negative consequences of the decision.
- Include potential trade-offs and risks.

### 6. Alternatives Considered

- List alternative solutions and why they were not chosen.

### 7. References

- Links to supporting documents, diagrams, or discussions.

## Steps to Prepare an ADR

1. **Identify the Decision**:

   - Determine the architectural decision that needs to be documented.

2. **Gather Context**:

   - Collect relevant information, including requirements, constraints, and discussions.

3. **Evaluate Alternatives**:

   - Explore possible solutions and assess their pros and cons.

4. **Make the Decision**:

   - Choose the best solution based on the evaluation.

5. **Document the ADR**:

   - Use the provided template to create a clear and concise record.

6. **Review and Approve**:

   - Share the ADR with the team for feedback and approval.

7. **Store and Maintain**:
   - Save the ADR in a centralized location for easy access.
   - Update the ADR if the decision changes.

## Best Practices

- Keep ADRs concise and focused.
- Use diagrams or visuals to enhance understanding.
- Ensure ADRs are version-controlled for traceability.
