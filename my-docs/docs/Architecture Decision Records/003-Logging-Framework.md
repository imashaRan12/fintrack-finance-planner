# Logging Framework

## Context

The application requires a robust logging framework to capture and analyze logs for debugging, monitoring, and compliance purposes. Key requirements include:

- Support for structured logging.
- Integration with log aggregation tools.
- Minimal performance overhead.

## Decision

We have decided to use **Winston** as the logging framework for the project.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Supports structured logging with JSON format.
  - Easily integrates with log aggregation tools like Elasticsearch and AWS CloudWatch.
  - Highly configurable with support for multiple transports (e.g., console, file, HTTP).
- **Negative**:
  - Requires additional setup for advanced features like log rotation.
  - Slightly higher learning curve compared to simpler logging libraries.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Bunyan**:
   - Pros: Simple and efficient for JSON logging.
   - Cons: Limited community support compared to Winston.
2. **Pino**:
   - Pros: Extremely fast and lightweight.
   - Cons: Less feature-rich for complex logging setups.
