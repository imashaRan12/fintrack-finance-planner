# Authentication Mechanism

## Context

The application requires a secure and scalable authentication mechanism to manage user access. Key requirements include:

- Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Integration with third-party identity providers.
- Scalability to handle a growing user base.

## Decision

We have decided to use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Industry-standard protocol with wide adoption.
  - Supports MFA and third-party integrations.
  - Scalable and secure.
- **Negative**:
  - Requires additional setup for identity providers.
  - Steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with OAuth 2.0.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Authentication**:
   - Pros: Full control over implementation.
   - Cons: High development and maintenance overhead.
2. **SAML**:
   - Pros: Mature protocol for enterprise use.
   - Cons: Complex to implement and less suited for modern web applications.
